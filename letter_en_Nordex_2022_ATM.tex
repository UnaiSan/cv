I am writing to apply for the \emph{Group Lead (m/f/d) Blade Engineering / Aerodynamic Tools} position advertised in Forum (P\&C HUB). I enclose my resumé, for references you can speak with Elena Llorente and Álvaro Gorostidi, who have been my managers for long time in Nordex (formerly Acciona), and thought I would be a suitable candidate for the position.

My experience of more than twenty years in wind turbine design with a special focus in blades, and the exposure I have had to several very high-level programming languages make good background for the position requirements. In dealing with a colleague more experienced in programming but less in wind turbine blades aerodynamics, or even less in our wind turbine blades, I can fill the gap in there to help them achieve the best results. When dealing with a colleague with more experience in some aspects of wind turbine blades but less in programming I can complement too their capabilities. We will be engineers who write code rather than programmers or software engineers, and I think I can gear the work towards being more helpful to our colleagues in Aerodynamics, our natural internal clients.

Apart from these technical aspects, I have enjoyed much these months of close interactions with our German colleagues, and I am convinced that I will be useful as the glue between both countries, even at this small scale. I have always considered myself more an observer than a pure national individual (of Spain and Spanish people and habits), so I may speak to our German colleagues as a more neutral person than someone with a lesser will to adopt foreign practices.

I can be reached via email at \href{mailto:USanMiguelAlzorriz@nordex-online.com}{USanMiguelAlzorriz@nordex-online.com} or Teams.

Thank you for your time in considering my application, I look forward to hearing from you regarding the next steps in the process.
